# Tailwind Catalyst Theme

A modern color theme based on the docs of the UI kit [Catalyst](https://tailwindui.com/templates/catalyst) by Tailwind Labs.



## Install

1. Select `View → Command Palette` or press `⌘+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type and select the command `Extensions: Install Extensions` 
3. Search for "Catalyst Theme" and click `Install`

## Font

I recommend using the font [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases/latest) with Catalyst Theme for the best experience. With Fira Code installed, navigate to your VS Code `settings.json` file via the Command Palette and add this code to it:

```json
"editor.fontFamily": "Fira Code",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
```

_This theme is unofficial and is not affiliated with Tailwind Labs or Fira Code in any way._
