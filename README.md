# Tailwind Catalyst Theme

A modern color theme based on the docs of the UI kit [Catalyst]("https://tailwindui.com/templates/catalyst") by Tailwind Labs

## Getting Started

To get the best experience out of Catalyst Theme, please follow the following configuration instructions:

1. Install the font [Fira Code]("https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases/latest") from GitHub. Then add this code to your VScode `settings.json` file: 
```
"editor.fontFamily": "Fira Code",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
"editor.lineHeight": 20,
"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": false,
```

2. There is a second theme in this extension called **Tailwind Catalyst - Colored Status Bar**. Try it out, see if you prefer it.
